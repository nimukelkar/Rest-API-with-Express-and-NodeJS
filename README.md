# Rest-API-with-Express-and-NodeJS
Created a Rest API with NodeJS and Express

What is an API?
      An API is an Application Programming Interface, that basically helps one software to talk to another.
We hear about different kinds of API's like twitter's API or Instagram's API.Here we mean REST API's.
REST is Representational State Transfer.
      A Rest API pretty much works like a normal website.We make a call from the client to the server and we get data back via the http protocol.
It is made up of JSON files and javascript commands, with easy key value pairs.
      Avery popular API is the google maps that takes in a city name or an address and gives you gps coordinates. 
Filtering of data base based on id, post,get, patch, delete have been implemented using postman service by me in this project.
